# ida-exportsymbols

IDA plugin to export symbols from IDA database to ELF file or plaintext.

Added support for IDA 7.4+ (Python 3.8), original repo only works for 7.0-7.3. Tested on IDA Pro 7.7, IDA Pro 8.3 and IDA Pro 9.1.

Idea taken from https://github.com/danigargu/syms2elf but written from scratch.

## Installation

Copy all files from plugin durectory to IDA plugin directory.

## Usage

- Open and parse any ELF file. Then click "Edit->Plugins->Export symbols to file".

- Select segments that you would like to export symbols such as `.text` / `.data` / `.bss`. 

- To quickly select custom segments, use `Select custom` button. You can modify default custom segments in the first line of `exportsymbols.py` :

    ```
    USER_SEGMENTS = ['.text', '.data', '.bss', '.rodata']
    ```

- Change export symbols types and options as you want. 

- In file dialog, You can save file as plaintext or a copy of input ELF file with IDA symbols imported by selecting file type.

There is a bug that exporting `extern` segment **might fail** for unknown reason. Make sure to 
backup original file and use at your own risk.


## Difference from original

- Updated idapython api
- Redesigned dialog using layouts for better flexibility instead of hard-coded setGeometry.
- More convenient selection buttons
- Fix some bugs.
